            <main class="rec">
                <p>Below are reviews for some of my favorite roguelikes that I highly recommend. I opted to highlight just 8 games to keep things concise. Each game offers its own unique elements, so whether you're familiar with roguelikes or just starting out, there should be something here for you. My scores reflect my personal experience, but I encourage you to explore and see what resonates with you.</p>
                <h3>Before diving into the reviews, let's clarify a few nuances:</h3>
                <p class="italicize">Roguelike vs. Roguelite</p>
                <p>There is a difference here, mainly when it comes to meta progression. Roguelikes typically have permanent death and no global upgrades that affect your future runs. Roguelites, on the other hand, also have permanent death but let you earn currency/unlockables that grants global upgrades, making each run a bit easier as you go. Most of the games I'll be discussing are considered roguelites, but for consistency—and because the terms get mixed up a lot—I'll just refer to everything as roguelikes.</p>
                <p>I'll be honest: my experience with classic roguelikes is pretty limited. They often play like old-school 'pen and paper RPGs', which makes them a bit tough for me to get into. But don't worry—I've got a review of a classic roguelike at the bottom of the page that I think is worth checking out!</p>
                <p class="italicize">Ascension System</p>
                <p>This term may come up frequently in my reviews. I borrowed the concept from Slay the Spire, which was the first roguelike to bring this mechanic to mainstream attention. An ascension system typically involves progressively increasing the difficulty of the game with each run, often introducing new challenges and rewards as players improve their skills and strategies. This innovative approach inspired many other developers to incorporate similar mechanics into their own games.</p>
                <h4>Now that we've got that out of the way, here are some of my recommendations:</h4>

                                    One of the few notable roguelike FPS games on the market, aside from another mentioned here and *maybe* a couple more. The gunplay is fast-paced but deliberate, emphasizing weapon choice and character development. Combat pacing resembles arcade shooters like (older gen)COD, with limited movement and a focus on positioning and aim. Builds offer good variety, and each character features unique abilities and a meta-progressive skill tree.

                                    A strong contender for anyone's top 3, Slay the Spire is one of the most acclaimed roguelikes—and indie games—out there, and for good reason. In this deckbuilder, you ascend a spire, battling enemies and building your deck along the way. It's one of my all-time favorites, nearly perfect in my view. It's also the kind of game that even non-gamers could easily get hooked on.

                                    Calling this a roguelike might be a stretch (runs can span 2-3 play sessions), but it scratches that itch nonetheless. If you're familiar with the Mount & Blade series, think of Battle Brothers as a "lite" version. You start as an unknown leader of a mercenary band, aiming to build your army and renown through battles, contracts, and trading. Permanent troop deaths can lead to significant losses, especially in the late game. The combat and management mechanics are incredibly fun in my opinion.

                                    The other roguelike FPS. While the gameplay loop resembles Gunfire Reborn, it stands out by trading some build/gun variety for intense, high-octane combat. This game’s fast pace will appeal to fans of the “boomer-shooter” FPS genre. The maps are designed for full mobility—you can jump, slide, railgrind, and jetpack through levels. Damage dealt to both you and enemies is roughly balanced.

                                    From the creators of FTL, Into the Breach is an engaging mech strategy game. You control three time-traveling mech pilots as you battle to prevent an alien invasion. The combat resembles chess, with each mech possessing unique attacks and abilities within a grid-based layout. Although it doesn't align with my personal interests (I'm not a fan of mech themes), the gameplay loop is highly enjoyable and offers a depth comparable to FTL.

                                    One of the few cooking roguelikes, Plate Up! offers a fun, casual experience, especially with friends. You run a restaurant, preparing meals and serving customers, using your earnings to upgrade the establishment each day. If you've played Overcooked, you'll feel right at home with the gameplay.

                                Caves of Qud is one of the most notable titles in the classic roguelike genre. It strikes a good balance between traditional mechanics and a modern interface. The game features a richly detailed world filled with deep lore and unique characters, allowing players to immerse themselves in its intricate narratives. <br><br>One of its standout elements is the character creation system, where you can choose from a variety of mutations—like growing extra limbs or harnessing the power of the elements—each with its own gameplay implications. Each run offers a vast array of choices, from how you approach exploration to the tactical decision-making required in combat against the strange NPCs you encounter. Aside from the questline and the towns, everything is procedurally generated, offering a fresh experience every time you dive into the depths, whether you're exploring ancient ruins or engaging in thrilling encounters in the wild.<br><br>I personally consider it the most beginner-friendly classic roguelike for those looking to explore the genre. It's the only one I've tried that truly hooked me—so much so that I had to force myself to stop, while I wait for the 1.0 release this winter after a 15+ year-long development cycle. I'm eagerly anticipating that before I dive deeper into the game.
